      <div className="text-secondary-foreground/80 space-y-4">
        <p>
          Our wall panels are made from Stone Polymer Composite (SPC), a high-tech, eco-friendly material renowned for its durability and stability. SPC is composed of natural limestone powder, polyvinyl chloride, and stabilizers, creating a core that is incredibly dense and 100% waterproof.
        </p>
        <p>
          This innovative composition makes our panels resistant to impacts, scratches, and temperature fluctuations, ensuring they maintain their beauty for years to come. They are a perfect choice for both residential and commercial applications, offering a sophisticated look without the maintenance of traditional materials.
