# Agent Rules for This Repo

## Napkin (Codex-only)

- At session start, read `.codex/napkin.md` before doing any other work.
- Apply the notes silently while working; do not announce that you read the napkin.
- Update `.codex/napkin.md` continuously with mistakes, corrections, user preferences, what worked, and what failed.
- Log your own mistakes as well as user corrections.
- If `.codex/napkin.md` is missing, create it from this template:

```md
# Napkin

## Corrections
| Date | Source | What Went Wrong | What To Do Instead |
|------|--------|----------------|-------------------|

## User Preferences
- (accumulate here as you learn them)

## Patterns That Work
- (approaches that succeeded)

## Patterns That Don't Work
- (approaches that failed and why)

## Domain Notes
- (project/domain context that matters)
```
