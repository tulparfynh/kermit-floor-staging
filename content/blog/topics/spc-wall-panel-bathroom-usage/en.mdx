Bathrooms need materials that can handle humidity, cleaning routines, and daily use. SPC wall panels are often selected to simplify renovation and reduce grout maintenance.

## Why SPC panels are considered

- Moisture-tolerant material structure
- Fast installation over suitable existing surfaces
- Easy cleaning compared to grout-heavy systems

## Installation checkpoints

1. Confirm substrate is stable and dry.
2. Apply the recommended adhesive system.
3. Seal critical joints and transitions with correct detail accessories.

## Maintenance expectations

SPC panels require routine cleaning with non-aggressive products. Avoid abrasive chemicals and follow project-specific technical guidance.

## Project fit

For bathrooms where fast renovation and consistent visual finish matter, SPC wall panels are a strong option when installed with correct detailing.
