SPC and laminate can look similar, but they behave differently when daily traffic and moisture increase.

## Water resistance

SPC is built for wet-prone zones such as kitchens, corridors, and light-commercial spaces. Laminate performs well in dry rooms, but standing water can damage core layers over time.

## Durability under traffic

SPC uses a rigid stone-polymer core. This improves dimensional stability and impact performance in high-use areas.

## Installation and maintenance

- Both systems can be installed quickly with click profiles.
- Subfloor quality still matters for long-term results.
- Cleaning routines are simple for both, but SPC offers more tolerance to accidental spills.

## When to choose SPC

Choose SPC when project requirements include moisture risk, frequent cleaning, and predictable long-term performance.
